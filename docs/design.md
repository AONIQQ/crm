# Design — Rules for AI Agents

- /packages/ui is the single source of truth for all UI.
- Always use shared shadcn components from /packages/ui.
- Do not override component styles with className.
- Do not introduce custom border radii, spacing, colours, shadows, or other visual deviations.
- No rounded corners.
- If a component needs a new variant or style, implement it in /packages/ui so the entire application stays consistent.
